# Match Manager Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key goals for Match Manager PRD:

• **Reduce volunteer coach cognitive load by 60%** through automated substitution tracking and visual decision support
• **Deliver offline-first Progressive Web App** that works reliably during games without internet connectivity
• **Achieve equal playing time management** with configurable strategies supporting different coaching philosophies
• **Provide intuitive formation-based visual interface** optimized for quick sideline decision-making under pressure
• **Support 100 active teams within 12 months** demonstrating market validation and sustainable growth
• **Enable coaches to focus on actual coaching** rather than administrative roster management tasks

### Background Context

**Match Manager** addresses a critical gap in youth soccer coaching tools where volunteer coaches experience overwhelming cognitive load managing substitutions and playing time during games. Current solutions either don't exist (paper-based tracking) or are designed for professional coaches with different needs and complexity requirements.

The core problem is that roster management has become a "full-time job" preventing coaches from focusing on player development, game strategy, and mentoring. This leads to coach burnout, reduced volunteer retention, and degraded game experience for both coaches and players. Match Manager transforms this complex administrative burden into simple visual recognition through formation displays, automated alerts, and configurable playing time strategies specifically designed for the volunteer youth soccer market.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Primary Focus:** Cognitive load reduction through visual simplicity and spatial recognition rather than complex data displays. The interface prioritizes immediate visual comprehension over comprehensive information density, enabling split-second decision making during game pressure.

**Core Principle:** "See it, know it, act on it" - every critical decision should be visually obvious within 2 seconds of looking at the screen. Red/green color coding for substitutions, formation-based layout matching real field positions, and minimal text-heavy interfaces.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Touch-First Design:** All interactions optimized for finger touch, including operation with gloves in cold weather. Large touch targets (minimum 44px), swipe gestures for quick actions, and minimal precise tapping required.

**One-Handed Operation:** Interface designed for single-hand operation while holding clipboard, whistle, or managing equipment. Critical functions accessible via thumb reach on standard smartphone sizes.

**Confirmation Workflows:** Two-step confirmation for irreversible actions (like finalizing substitutions) but single-tap for routine decisions (acknowledging alerts, viewing player status).

**Visual-First Communication:** Color coding, icons, and spatial positioning convey information faster than text labels. Formation display uses actual field positions rather than abstract lists.

### Core Screens and Views

**Formation Display Screen** - Primary game management view showing field layout with current player positions and substitution status
**Match Setup Wizard** - Pre-game configuration for roster, strategy, and formation selection
**Substitution Alert Panel** - Modal overlay with pending substitution recommendations and timing
**Playing Time Dashboard** - Quick overview of minutes played per player with balance indicators
**Game Clock & Controls** - Always-visible timer with start/stop controls and period management
**Player Status Panel** - Detailed view of individual player availability, positions, and playing time

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

**Visual Requirements:** High contrast ratios for outdoor sunlight readability, large text sizing options, color-blind friendly color schemes with pattern/shape alternatives to red/green coding.

**Motor Accessibility:** Large touch targets, simplified gestures, and voice confirmation options for hands-busy situations.

### Branding

**Utilitarian Sports Aesthetic:** Clean, professional design reflecting serious coaching tools rather than consumer gaming apps. Green field background with white line markings as visual foundation, complemented by team color customization options.

**Trust and Reliability Signals:** Visual cues emphasizing accuracy, timing precision, and professional coaching support rather than flashy or entertainment-focused design elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary:** Mobile-first Progressive Web App optimized for smartphones in portrait orientation
**Secondary:** Tablet support for assistant coaches and pre-game planning
**Minimum Support:** Desktop browsers for initial setup and configuration management

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository containing all Match Manager components (PWA frontend, future API services, shared utilities, and deployment configurations).

**Rationale:** Your existing Next.js 15 setup already establishes monorepo foundation. For MVP scope focusing on client-side functionality, monorepo provides simplicity while accommodating future backend services without major restructuring.

### Service Architecture

**Primary Architecture:** Client-first monolith with all game management logic running locally in the browser

**Future Evolution Path:** Serverless functions for cloud sync and organization-level features in Phase 2, maintaining client-side autonomy as core principle

**Key Technical Decision:** All critical functionality (formation management, substitution alerts, playing time tracking) operates independently of backend services. API layer designed as enhancement rather than dependency.

### Testing Requirements

**MVP Testing Strategy:** Unit testing for core game logic components (playing time calculations, substitution algorithms, formation management) with manual testing convenience methods for UI workflows

**Testing Priorities:** Focus on offline functionality validation, state persistence testing, and touch interaction reliability. Automated tests for mathematical accuracy of playing time distribution algorithms.

**Phase 2 Expansion:** Integration testing for cloud sync, end-to-end testing for complete user journeys, and performance testing under field conditions.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router (already established), React 19, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS v4 for responsive design optimized for mobile-first PWA

**State Management:** Client-side state management solution optimized for offline-first operation, likely Context API with useReducer for complex game state, with persistence layer using IndexedDB

**PWA Requirements:** Service worker for offline functionality, Web App Manifest for installation, background sync capabilities for eventual cloud features, push notifications for substitution alerts

**Performance Constraints:** Bundle size optimization for mobile networks, lazy loading for non-critical features, efficient re-rendering strategies for real-time updates during games

**Browser Storage:** IndexedDB as primary storage for game data, settings, and team configurations. LocalStorage for user preferences and lightweight session data

**Deployment Architecture:** Static site generation with edge CDN distribution, serverless functions for future API endpoints, global edge optimization to minimize latency

**Development Tools:** ESLint with Next.js TypeScript config (already configured), Turbo for build optimization, TypeScript strict mode with path mapping

**Security Considerations:** Client-side data encryption for sensitive player information, COPPA compliance planning for youth data handling, secure authentication patterns for future cloud sync
