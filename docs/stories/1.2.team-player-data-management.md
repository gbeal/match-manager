# Story 1.2: Team and Player Data Management

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** volunteer coach,
**I want** to create and manage my team roster with player names and basic information,
**so that** I can digitally organize my team before moving to advanced game management.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create team with team name and basic configuration settings
2. Add players to roster with name, jersey number, and availability status
3. Edit and remove players from team roster as needed
4. All team and player data persists locally using IndexedDB for offline storage
5. Data remains available after app restart or device reboot
6. Simple, touch-optimized interface for roster management
7. Validation prevents duplicate jersey numbers within team

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in Epic 1.

### Data Models
**Team Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#team]:
```typescript
interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  settings: TeamSettings;
}

interface TeamSettings {
  defaultFormation: Formation;
  preferredStrategy: SubstitutionStrategy;
  defaultShiftLength: number; // minutes
  advanceWarningTime: number; // minutes
}
```

**Player Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player]:
```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;
  teamId: string;
  name: string;
  jerseyNumber: number;
  positions: Position[];
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

type Position = 'goalkeeper' | 'defender' | 'midfielder' | 'forward';
```

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for MVP - operates offline-first with IndexedDB storage only [Source: architecture/external-apis.md#current-mvp-status].

### Component Specifications
**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
- Setup components in `src/components/setup/`
- TeamSetup and PlayerSetup follow standard component template
- Touch-optimized with minimum 44px targets [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Use React Context + useReducer for state management

**PWA Shell Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#pwa-shell-component]:
- All features must work offline-first
- Integration with OfflineContext for network status

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Types: `packages/shared/src/types/`
- Components: `src/components/setup/TeamSetup/`, `src/components/setup/PlayerSetup/`
- State: `src/stores/TeamContext.tsx`
- Persistence: `src/services/persistence/`
- Routes: `src/app/teams/`
- Tests: `tests/components/`, `tests/services/`, `tests/e2e/`

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- Component tests in `tests/components/` using Jest + React Testing Library
- Service tests in `tests/services/` for repository pattern validation
- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/` using Playwright for complete workflows

**Test Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-examples]:
- Component tests must verify accessibility (screen reader support)
- Repository tests must validate IndexedDB operations and constraints
- E2E tests must verify offline functionality and data persistence

### Technical Constraints
- TypeScript strict mode enabled [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All state updates must be immutable [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- IndexedDB access only through repository pattern [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Touch optimization required for mobile-first design [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Test files located in `tests/components/`, `tests/services/`, `tests/e2e/`
- Use Jest + React Testing Library for component tests [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Use Playwright for E2E testing with PWA support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All interactive elements must be tested for 44px minimum touch targets
- IndexedDB persistence must be tested for offline functionality
- Repository pattern tests required for data validation and constraints
