**Session Date:** September 14, 2025
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Product Owner

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Youth Soccer Team Management App MVP - Features for volunteer coaches managing lineups, substitutions, and playing time

**Session Goals:** Focus on MVP features: starting lineup builder, substitution management, equal playing time tracking, and game clock/score keeping

**Techniques Used:** Progressive Technique Flow (What If Scenarios → Mind Mapping → Assumption Reversal → Morphological Analysis → First Principles Thinking)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ specific features and insights

### Key Themes Identified:
- Cognitive load reduction as primary value proposition
- Visual/spatial interface design for sideline use
- Configurable strategies to accommodate different coaching philosophies
- Offline-first architecture for rural field conditions
- Position-aware intelligence for smart substitution suggestions
- Flexible data model supporting various age groups and league rules

## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 10 minutes
**Description:** Explored ambitious possibilities to open creative thinking

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Coaches feeling as confident as professional coaches through pre-set lineups and automated substitution management
2. Predictive substitution scenarios with advance warnings and position-aware suggestions
3. AI learning from coaching patterns over multiple games (noted as post-MVP)

**Insights Discovered:**
- Core value is cognitive load reduction - handling mechanics so coaches can focus on coaching
- Position eligibility mapping is essential for intelligent substitution suggestions
- Predictive assistance significantly more valuable than reactive tools

**Notable Connections:**
- Substitution management connects directly to playing time equality goals
- Position flexibility directly impacts formation display and tactical planning

### Mind Mapping - 20 minutes
**Description:** Systematically explored MVP feature components and their relationships

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Starting Lineup Components:** Player availability, position eligibility, substitution patterns by position (goalies vs field players)
2. **Player Availability States:** Present/absent, injury status, early departure requirements
3. **Match Configuration:** Number of players on field (age/league dependent), formation selection
4. **Substitution Management:** Formation-based visual display, red/green color coding, advance prep alerts, manual confirmation workflow
5. **Substitution Strategies:** Equal playing time, minimum minutes per player, gameplay-based (no time constraints)
6. **Playing Time Display:** Whole minutes only, gross inequity prevention, injury adaptation
7. **Game Clock Features:** Configurable format (halves, minutes), always-running unofficial clock, simple scorebox with spinners

**Insights Discovered:**
- Different positions require different substitution patterns (goalies vs field players)
- Visual formation display with color coding optimal for sideline decision-making
- Configurable substitution strategies essential for different coaching philosophies
- Whole minutes tracking prevents distracting precision, focuses on preventing gross inequity

**Notable Connections:**
- Formation display directly connects to position eligibility and substitution management
- Playing time tracking must integrate with substitution alerts and suggestions
- Game clock independence from player timers allows flexible workflow

### Assumption Reversal - 5 minutes
**Description:** Challenged core assumptions to stress-test the MVP concept

**Ideas Generated:**
1. Confirmed device-first approach - coaches wanting paper tools are not target market
2. Established organizational hierarchy: Soccer organization rules → Coach implementation → App facilitation
3. Reinforced scope boundary - app doesn't navigate parent politics, just helps coaches execute chosen strategy

**Insights Discovered:**
- Clear target market definition eliminates scope creep
- Organizational rule compliance is framework, not app responsibility
- Future preset configurations could be based on age group and organization standards

### Morphological Analysis & First Principles - 10 minutes
**Description:** Synthesized core components and identified fundamental value proposition

**Ideas Generated:**
1. **Primary User Workflow:** Pre-game configuration → availability adjustment → timer start → prep alerts → substitution confirmation → goal tracking
2. **Core Problem Statement:** "Roster management is a full-time job" - coaches managing subs instead of coaching players
3. **Fundamental Value:** Cognitive load relief allowing coaches to focus on actual coaching

**Insights Discovered:**
- 2-minute prep window (6min alert for 8min shifts) provides crucial communication time
- Independent game clock and player timers allow flexible workflow management
- Local storage MVP eliminates complexity while proving concept

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Cognitive Load is the Core Problem:** The fundamental issue isn't tactical sophistication but mental burden relief
- **Visual Communication Trumps Data:** Formation displays with color coding more valuable than detailed statistics
- **Flexibility Over Rigidity:** Configurable strategies accommodate diverse coaching philosophies better than one-size-fits-all
- **Offline-First is Essential:** Rural fields and poor connectivity make local storage a requirement, not convenience
- **Scope Discipline Creates Value:** Focusing on core substitution management delivers more value than feature bloat
- **Position Intelligence is Differentiator:** Understanding position eligibility makes suggestions actually useful

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for prototype, 4-6 weeks for production ready

#### #2 Priority: Configurable Match Setup System
- **Rationale:** Foundation for all other features - must handle diverse league rules and coaching preferences
- **Next steps:** Define data schema for players/positions/strategies, create setup wizard flow, implement local storage
- **Resources needed:** Product requirements documentation, database design, frontend forms development
- **Timeline:** 3-4 weeks for complete implementation

#### #3 Priority: Substitution Alert and Tracking Engine
- **Rationale:** The "brain" that provides cognitive load relief - timing alerts and playing time calculations
