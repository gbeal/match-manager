# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key goals for Match Manager PRD:

• **Reduce volunteer coach cognitive load by 60%** through automated substitution tracking and visual decision support
• **Deliver offline-first Progressive Web App** that works reliably during games without internet connectivity
• **Achieve equal playing time management** with configurable strategies supporting different coaching philosophies
• **Provide intuitive formation-based visual interface** optimized for quick sideline decision-making under pressure
• **Support 100 active teams within 12 months** demonstrating market validation and sustainable growth
• **Enable coaches to focus on actual coaching** rather than administrative roster management tasks

## Background Context

**Match Manager** addresses a critical gap in youth soccer coaching tools where volunteer coaches experience overwhelming cognitive load managing substitutions and playing time during games. Current solutions either don't exist (paper-based tracking) or are designed for professional coaches with different needs and complexity requirements.

The core problem is that roster management has become a "full-time job" preventing coaches from focusing on player development, game strategy, and mentoring. This leads to coach burnout, reduced volunteer retention, and degraded game experience for both coaches and players. Match Manager transforms this complex administrative burden into simple visual recognition through formation displays, automated alerts, and configurable playing time strategies specifically designed for the volunteer youth soccer market.
