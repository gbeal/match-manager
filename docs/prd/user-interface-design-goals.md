# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

**Primary Focus:** Cognitive load reduction through visual simplicity and spatial recognition rather than complex data displays. The interface prioritizes immediate visual comprehension over comprehensive information density, enabling split-second decision making during game pressure.

**Core Principle:** "See it, know it, act on it" - every critical decision should be visually obvious within 2 seconds of looking at the screen. Red/green color coding for substitutions, formation-based layout matching real field positions, and minimal text-heavy interfaces.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Touch-First Design:** All interactions optimized for finger touch, including operation with gloves in cold weather. Large touch targets (minimum 44px), swipe gestures for quick actions, and minimal precise tapping required.

**One-Handed Operation:** Interface designed for single-hand operation while holding clipboard, whistle, or managing equipment. Critical functions accessible via thumb reach on standard smartphone sizes.

**Confirmation Workflows:** Two-step confirmation for irreversible actions (like finalizing substitutions) but single-tap for routine decisions (acknowledging alerts, viewing player status).

**Visual-First Communication:** Color coding, icons, and spatial positioning convey information faster than text labels. Formation display uses actual field positions rather than abstract lists.

## Core Screens and Views

**Formation Display Screen** - Primary game management view showing field layout with current player positions and substitution status
**Match Setup Wizard** - Pre-game configuration for roster, strategy, and formation selection
**Substitution Alert Panel** - Modal overlay with pending substitution recommendations and timing
**Playing Time Dashboard** - Quick overview of minutes played per player with balance indicators
**Game Clock & Controls** - Always-visible timer with start/stop controls and period management
**Player Status Panel** - Detailed view of individual player availability, positions, and playing time

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

**Visual Requirements:** High contrast ratios for outdoor sunlight readability, large text sizing options, color-blind friendly color schemes with pattern/shape alternatives to red/green coding.

**Motor Accessibility:** Large touch targets, simplified gestures, and voice confirmation options for hands-busy situations.

## Branding

**Utilitarian Sports Aesthetic:** Clean, professional design reflecting serious coaching tools rather than consumer gaming apps. Green field background with white line markings as visual foundation, complemented by team color customization options.

**Trust and Reliability Signals:** Visual cues emphasizing accuracy, timing precision, and professional coaching support rather than flashy or entertainment-focused design elements.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary:** Mobile-first Progressive Web App optimized for smartphones in portrait orientation
**Secondary:** Tablet support for assistant coaches and pre-game planning
**Minimum Support:** Desktop browsers for initial setup and configuration management
