2. Formation selection interface with visual field representation
3. Formation data includes position count and basic spatial arrangement
4. Selected formation persists with team configuration data
5. Formation choice validates against available players and position eligibilities
6. Simple formation switching capability for tactical adjustments
7. Formation data integrates with position eligibility system for validation

## Story 1.5: Game Session Initialization

I want to start a new game session with my configured team,
so that I can transition from team setup to active game management.
