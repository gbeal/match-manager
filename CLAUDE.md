# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15 Progressive Web App (PWA) called "match-manager" built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. The application is designed as an offline-first coaching tool for volunteer soccer coaches. The project uses Turbo for faster builds and development.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbo and PWA functionality
- `npm run build` - Build production PWA with service worker generation
- `npm start` - Start production server (test PWA in production mode)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## PWA Development Notes

- Service worker automatically generated by @ducanh2912/next-pwa
- Manifest file at `/manifest.webmanifest` (auto-generated from `src/app/manifest.ts`)
- PWA icons located in `public/icons/` directory
- Offline fallback page at `/offline`
- To test PWA features: build the app (`npm run build`) and run `npm start`
- Install prompt will appear on supported browsers after first visit
- All features designed to work offline-first

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and PWA support
- **PWA Features**: Service worker, offline support, installable, responsive
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS and mobile-first design
- **Fonts**: Geist and Geist Mono from Google Fonts
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with path mapping (`@/*` â†’ `./src/*`)
- **Linting**: ESLint with Next.js TypeScript config
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for offline data persistence (future implementation)

## Project Structure

- `src/app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  - `layout.tsx` - Root layout with font configuration
  - `page.tsx` - Homepage component
  - `globals.css` - Global styles including Tailwind directives
- `public/` - Static assets (SVG icons, favicon)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict settings
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint flat config with Next.js rules
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `postcss.config.mjs` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind

## BMad Development Workflow

This project uses the BMad Method with integrated Test Architect (Quinn) for quality assurance. The workflow includes story creation, implementation, and comprehensive testing at multiple stages. See `.bmad-core/enhanced-ide-development-workflow.md` for detailed workflow guidance.

## Key Development Notes

- Uses Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with modern configuration
- Turbo mode enabled for faster development and builds
- TypeScript path mapping configured for clean imports
- ESLint configured with Next.js and TypeScript best practices
